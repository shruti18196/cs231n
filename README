This is a collection of the assignments of the Stanford University course on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition(CS231n).

ASSIGNMENT-1 

understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)

understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for HYPERPARAMETER tuning.

implement and apply a k-nearest neighbor (knn) classifier,a Multiclass 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier,a Softmax classifier,a Two layer neural network classifier

understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers

get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features).


ASSIGNMENT-2

understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures

understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation

implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks

implement Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks

implement Dropout to regularize networks

understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data

gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
